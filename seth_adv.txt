You heave up on the latch as you hear an ungodly scream come from the top floor.
You start panicking as your heart begins thundering in your chest
You're in danger
You decide not to stick around and find out what made that noise
You jump down the open trapdoor and find tunnels beneath the house
You crawl for what seems like miles but finally end up above ground, directly in front of the old house.
You turn on your heels and decide to take up a new hobby that doesn't involve screeching monsters
